At a threshing session to consider Canadian Yearly Meeting action on marriage, the main difficulty was in understanding that marriage could exist before God, and not before the law. There was the same reluctance to the use of the word “marriage” to describe committed relationships between gay and lesbian couples, but further consideration of the word “marriage,” which these days does not necessarily include procreation as its main purpose, and long ago was not recognized in law if performed by Quakers, showed that there was nothing against the use of this word, except for personal beliefs, to stand in the way. We remembered discussion at the lst Yearly Meeting on the need to comply with provincial regulations, and we decided that if a couple, of whatever genders, decided not to comply with the law, but still wished the Society of Friends and the world at large to recognize their commitment to each other, the way should be made open for them by removing from the Canadian Yearly Meeting Organization and Procedure noted on marriage, the need to comply with provincial laws and regulations.
