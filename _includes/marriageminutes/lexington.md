Lexington Friends Meeting is committed to honoring a request to seek clearness from any member wishing to join with another person in union under the care of the Meeting. Because same-gender couples may desire community affirmation of their relationships, the Meeting offers them its guidance and support. We respect the right of couples to designate their relationship in the terms they wish. As in all unions under the care of the Meeting, the marriage procedure in the OVYM Book of Discipline will serve as a guide. We recognize our responsibility to continue to provide care and support for each relationship, for both partners as individuals, and for children of the relationship.
