We continue to respect the desire of homosexual couples within the meeting to formalize their feelings of mutual commitment, to enter into relationships under divine guidance in a spirit of reverence and love, and to bear witness to their commitment before God, to the meeting community and to the public.

1 April 2007:

Recognizing that of God in all persons, we continue to respect the desire of all loving couples, however they may define themselves as to sexuality and gender, to celebrate their love and commitment by entering into marriage under divine guidance in a spirit of reverence and love. When one or both of the partners are members of Brooklyn Monthly Meeting, we will bear witness to their love as they bear witness, in the manner of Friends, to their commitment before God, the meeting community, and the public.
