Minute for Same-Sex Marriage 

January 1993

From our belief that there is that of God in everyone, flows our testimony on the equality of all persons. Thus, Central Philadelphia Monthly Meeting affirms our willingness to celebrate marriages of all couples, including lesbian and gay, who have a substantial relationship with our meeting. In each case we will follow the same careful process of arriving at clearness in accordance with our traditional procedures. At every stage we intend to treat all couples with respect, care and love.
