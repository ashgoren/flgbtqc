Minute on Same-Sex Marriages

"In 1669 George Fox described it [marriage] this way: 'For the right joining in marriage is the work of the Lord only, and not the priests or magustrates; for it is God's ordinance and not Man's; and therefore Friends cannot consent that they should join them together; for we marry none; it is the Lord's work, and we are but witnesses.'"

(Quote from Jan Hoffman, "Clearness Committees for Marriage or Commitment," in Pastoral Care Newsletter, II:4, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, May, 1995.)

We recognize that faithful, spiritual and committed relationships exist within same sex and mixed sex couples. A couple in such a relatonship, at least one of the partners being a member or regular attender of this Meeting, may be led to seek the Meeting's recognition and spiritual affermation by requesting that their relationship be formally taken under the care of the Meeting. On receiving such request the Meeting shall undertake the processes of clearness and oversight, following the Guide to our Faith and Our Practice of our Yearly Meeting. If the result is a wedding or ceremony of commitment under care of the Meeting, we recognize the certificate signed by all present at the called meeting for worship as the only formal expression necessary to witness the couple's union.

Queries to facilitate this process:

Do we affirm all relationships within the meeting community as being, in some sense, under the pastoral care of our meeting?

How do we provide ongoing care, support, and attention to the relationships under our care?

Are we mindful of the legal and social privileges accorded to members in a heterosexual marriage, and supportive of those excluded from such provoleges? Are we willing to work to remedy legal inequities and discrimination?
