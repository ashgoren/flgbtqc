1987

Among basic human rights, the freedom to love and marry is surely one of the dearest to the human heart. While many take this freedom for granted, those who love and marry persons of their own sex are often persecuted and encounter discrimination and violence. As a community of faith, dedicated to ideals of harmony and social justice and the inestimable worth of every child of God, we abhor this persecution, the prejudice and this violence.

Eugene Monthly Meeting of Friends therefore extends its loving care, and support to all individuals and couples in our community regardless of sexual orientation. We acknowledge and appreciate all relationships centered in love, and we recognize marriage as a covenant between God and two persons, regardless of gender.
