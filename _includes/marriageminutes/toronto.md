Minutes of the Specially Called Meeting in regard to Relationships held January 30, 1994 at Friends' House. 60 Lowther Avenue, Toronto, Ontario at 1:00 p.m.

The Meeting opened with a period of silent worship. AH read Section 403 of Christian Faith and Practice. She then read Minutes 72 and 73 from Canadian Yearly Meeting 1993, and the request from Continuing Meeting of Ministry and Counsel that Monthly Meetings consider the broader issues of marriage relationships.

After discussion the following were approved:

We welcome same-gender couples to apply for marriage under the care of our Meeting, and will give them consideration as we would any other couple. This minute is approved. One Friend is recorded as not in unity with this minute.

We are reminded of George Fox's words (1669): "For the right joining in marriage is the work of the Lord only, and not the priests or magistrates; for it is God's ordinance and not Man's; and therefore Friends cannot consent that they should join them together; for we marry none; it is the Lord's work, and we are but witnesses."

We will continue to explore the ways that the Meeting can support and give continuing care to the whole range of relationships within the Meeting.

The Specially Called Meeting ended with silent worship, followed by AH reading Section 404 of Christian Faith and Practice.
