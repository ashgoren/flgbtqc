Minute on Same-gender Unions/Marriage

[The following minute was submitted to Seavile MM and approved on February 15, 2004. It was transmitted to Quarterly Meeting in session, 13 June 2004, for the consideration of other monthly meetings - Ed. of the Salem Quarter Newsletter]

The essence of intimacy between persons is a matter of love, tenderness, fidelity, and commitment. As a Monthly Meeting, we reach out in loving support to those who ask for help in achieving and maintaining these qualities in their relationship.

We believe it is consistent with Friends' historical faith and testimonies to adopt and practice a single standard for all committed relationships that are under our care. We are mindful that it is the Spirit which unites a couple, and we are the witnesses thereof.

We affirm our willingness as a Monthly Meeting to hold appointed meetings to celebrate and acknowledge couples' relationships. We will hold them in accordance with our traditional procedures, both for opposite-gender and same-gender couples, when one or both of the partners participate in our community as members or attenders. We intend to follow the same customary and careful process of arriving at clearness for all couples who wish to unite under our care, following Faith and Practice.

We affirm the traditional Quaker concept of marriage as a committed relationship between two people who share their lives as equal partners. We believe that because such a partnership is a spiritual union, it is appropriately recognized at an appointed meeting for worship among Friends and within the presence and the moving of the Spirit. It is our belief that both the Meeting and the partners are nourished by this celebration.

We understand that both opposite-gender and same-gender couples may prefer words other than marriage to describe their union. We leave it to the couple to name their union.

We recognize this meeting for the couple, and the certificate signed during that meeting, as the only necessary public expression of the union. The event shall be recorded in the Meeting records as is customary. The Meeting will assist the couple with legal recording requirements if requested. For all couples, advice will be available regarding legal arrangements for care of each other, of family, and of property.
