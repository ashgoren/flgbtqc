[The person who submitted the minute below said, “It appears the meeting is not yet ready to speak the term marriage and that discussion regarding this term as to both opposite and same-sex couples is needed. However, the minute addresses where the consensus occurs at this time.”]

This meeting offers to all persons our support and care for their relationships. We now affirm our willingness to hold celebrations of love and commitment under our care for both opposite and same sex couples, in accordance with our traditional procedures, when one or both of those partners participate in our meeting community as members or attenders and share our religious experience. We want our meeting community to be a place for lesbians and gay men to express among us tenderness and affection toward partners and friends. We commit ourselves to such efforts and learnings as are required for this to happen.
