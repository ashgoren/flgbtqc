For the right joining in marriage is the work of the Lord only, and not the priests’ or magistrates’; for it is God’s ordinance and not man’s; and therefore Friends cannot consent that they should join them together: for we marry none; it is the Lord’s work, and we are but witnesses.” George Fox, 1669

We are united in believing that committed loving relationships that are enduring, unselfish, mutually tender, and supportive are to be encouraged.

We believe it is consistent with Friends history, faith and testimonies to follow a single practice for all those in committed relationships requesting our care, regardless of whether the couples involved are of the same or opposite gender.

We affirm our willingness to hold meetings for worship in celebration of commitment/marriage for both opposite and same gender couples, when one or both persons hold membership in the Meeting. We intend to follow the careful process of arriving at clearness for any couple requesting oversight by the Meeting. We believe this to be in accordance with the customs and beliefs of Friends; and that such persons are deemed to be married in the eyes of God and hence in our Meeting. The Meeting respects the right of the couple to name their relationship but recognizes that our expression of Faith may not, in all instances, be accepted by certain secular authorities.
