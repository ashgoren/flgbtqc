From our belief that there is that of God in every person flows our testimony in the equality of all persons. We believe also that marriage is an important social and religious institution. We wish to encourage committed relationships, whether between same-sex or opposite-sex couples. Therefore, Utah Friends Fellowship supports the participation of monthly meetings and worship groups in same-sex marriages, conducted in the same manner, and with the same care, as marriages for opposite-sex couples.
