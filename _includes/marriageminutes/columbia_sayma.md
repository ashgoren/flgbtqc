The same term, marriage, will be used to designate the celebrations of commitment under the care of Columbia Monthly Meeting for both heterosexual couples and homosexual couples. The procedure of marriage under the care of the Meeting outlined in Faith and Practice shall be followed for all couples seeking clearness for marriage under the care of the Meeting. Ministry and Oversight is asked to recommend a series of queries for all couples concerning such topics as legal commitments, guardianship of child/parents, and inheritance issues.

Inherent rights afforded heterosexual couples are accepted by society at large and are provided for by the institution of marriage. Such unquestioned privileges include kinship and legal rights, shared health benefits, medical rights, rights of survivorship, child custody, contractual rights, and others. The Meeting looks to the day when every married couple will enjoy the full range of legal privileges and social acceptance, regardless of the respective genders of the members of the couple.

The meeting takes seriously its commitment to couples under its care and encourages them to turn to the Meeting for support and counsel.
