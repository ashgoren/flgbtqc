We believe that Friends testimony of equality requires a single standard of treatment for all human beings and that all people share equally in the Light.

We acknowledge, uphold and witness relationships centered in love and recognize marriage as a holy covenant of commitment and unity between committed persons, including members of the same sex.

We believe that it is consistent with Friends’ historical faith and testimonies to adopt a single standard of treatment and care for all committed relationships in the meeting. We intend to follow the same traditional, careful process for all who wish to unite under our care. Relationships grow and change and we recognize our responsibility to offer tender care and support to the union as well as the individuals involved in it as they continue to grow in understanding and in the Light.

There exits in law an unequal practice which allows benefits to those labeled as heterosexual (married or not) that are denied to those labeled as homosexuals. Friends historically have counseled and followed a higher law.

Chamisa Friends Meeting (preparative) recognizes the certificate of marriage signed by those united and those present at the ceremony as the only public expression necessary to certify the marriage. We leave to those joined to register their marriage in a court of law with the Meeting’s support and witness.
