The Religious Society of Friends from its beginnings has stressed the conviction that marriage is a binding relationship entered into in the presence of God and witnessing Friends. Because of the importance of this relationship, a procedure has grown-up among Friends that discourages hasty marriage and emphasizes consideration of those factors that may help or hinder the permanence of commitment and the happiness of those concerned.

Friends recognize that spiritually enriching relationships are those that are enduring and unselfish and provide mutual support and tenderness. There is a particular need to offer loving support to those who share relationships other than marriage as they do not always receive the support and approval of the community as a whole. Such relationships include other heterosexual, lesbian, gay, bisexual, or unlabelled couples.

If the Meeting feels that a relationship is committed and loving, a suitable opportunity might be found when Friends could express their love and support for these couples among us. Some may be supported by the Blessings of the Meeting Family.

“So may we reach to those we love truly desiring their wholeness, as we desire our own.” (Elizabeth Watson: Sexuality, a Part of Wholeness).
