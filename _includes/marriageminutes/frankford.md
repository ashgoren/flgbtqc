Minute for Same-Sex Marriage 

Approved November 17, 2002

"While most Friends' marriage ceremonies conform to civil law, couples who do not want, or are not eligible to contract, a legal marriage occasionally ask for a ceremony of commitment or wedding under the care of the Meeting. The Religious Society of Friends has long asserted its freedom to conduct under divine leading marriage ceremonies not conforming to civil law." Faith and Practice 1997, p 50.

"For the right joining in marriage is the work of the Lord only, and not the priest's or magistrates'; for it is God's ordinance and not man's; and therefore Friend's cannot consent that they should join them together: for we marry none; it is the Lord's work, and we are but witnesses." George Fox, 1669

Frankford Monthly Meeting wishes to affirm that we extend to all members of our community, whatever their sexual orientation, the same quality of love and support. We are one community of faith; we experience the varieties of love in our community as gifts of God. We affirm that we are all children of God and that we all have the same potential to reflect the Divine Light in our lives.

The Meeting is committed to nurturing all of the families within its community. We recognize that families composed of gay, lesbian, or bisexual parents and their children face additional difficulties in our society. The Meeting hopes to be a safe haven for these families and commits itself to providing special support to both the children and the parents. We strive to help all the Meeting's children learn to value and respect all individuals whatever their sexual orientation. For children who grow to understand their own sexual orientation or who believe themselves to be gay, lesbian, or bisexual, the Meeting wishes to offer support and affirmation.

Frankford Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends affirms the goodness of committed, loving relationships and offers recognition and support to those who share this ideal and desire to enter into a permanent relationship based upon it. By tradition the Meeting recognizes committed unions in a celebration of marriage under the care of the Meeting. The same loving care and consideration should be given to both same-sex and heterosexual applicants as outlined in Faith and Practice.
