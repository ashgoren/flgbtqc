We believe that Friendsâ€™ testimony of equality requires a single standard of treatment for all human beings and that all people share in the Light. We affirm that we welcome to our Meeting all who share our search for Truth. We therefore extend our loving care, concern, and support to all individuals and couples in our Meeting community, including lesbian, gay, and bisexual people. In all aspects of life, it is our wish to recognize as fully as we can the Light within us all by keeping open to the many reflections of that Light.

As Quakers, mindful of being effective witnesses for social justice, we commit ourselves to educating ourselves and others in the Religious Society of Friends about the condition of homosexual and bisexual people in a society that is frequently hostile to them. We also commit ourselves to action to end ignorance about, prejudice concerning, and discrimination against people based on their sexual orientation, both in the Religious Society of Friends and in society at large.
