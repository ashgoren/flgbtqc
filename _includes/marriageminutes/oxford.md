1998

We approved the following minute in 1998:

Continuing a process of thought and discussion we began in 1991, Oxford Friends are in unity about the following: Oxford Friends Meeting will consider the recognition of same-gender relationships through the same careful process that Friends use to arrive at clearness for any members or attenders who wish to unite in marriage under our care. We respect the right of couples to name their relationship.

We acknowledge the uneasiness that this step evokes in many thoughtful and loving Friends. However, we feel led to the present statement by a desire to affirm our commitment to honor and celebrate loving and stable relationships. We hope to remove prejudicial obstacles that hinder our ability to discern and encourage loving commitment between adult partners wherever such commitment may be found.
