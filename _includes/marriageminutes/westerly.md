June 1997

Westerly Friends affirm our belief that "there is that of God in every person." Furthermore, we attest that this principle embraces all individuals regardless of sexual orientation.

We rejoice in the love shared between two people as one of the greatest gifts of God. It is our hope that the religious life of the Meeting offers continuing tender support for all families in our Quaker community and we encourage and uphold all couples who wish to express their love, their spiritual union, and their commitment to one another in a permanent relationship.

The same loving care and considerations will be given to all couples, both of same-gender and of oppositegender, who request marriage under the care of the Meeting. The process for approval will follow the good order of Friends as described in Faith and Practice of the New England Yearly Meeting of Friends.
