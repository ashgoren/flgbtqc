Rochester Monthly Meeting affirms the goodness of committed, loving relationships that are enduring, unselfish, mutually tender, and supportive. We find it consistant with Friends’ belief in the Inner Light to recognize the loving commitment of two people, regardless of their sex.

We affirm our willingness as a Meeting to hold meetings for worship in celebration of loving commitment for both opposite sex and same sex couples.

We will follow the customary and careful process of arriving at clearness for any couple who request our oversight, provided that one or both partners are members of the Religious Society of Friends. We will follow our traditional procedures in the conduct of the special meeting for worship.

The couples’ choice of marriage, celebration of commitment, or some other term to best characterize the special meeting for worship and their ongoing relationship will be discussed in the clearness process and in the plans for the monthly meeting’s oversight of the special meeting.

At this time marriage of a same sex couple is not licensed or recognized be the State of New York. Couples whose marriages are not to be or cannot be registered with the state are counseled that the automatic legal guarantees and obligations with respect to inheritance of property, Social Security benefits, and guardianship of children do not apply. Legal contracts and wills can protect property and inheritance benefits for such couples.

Note of Explanation:”…We have, however, learned from other meetings who have dealt with the issue of same sex marriages before, and we share our minute gladly. We reviewed several earlier statements from others and had a series of discussion sessions in which background information was shared and personal experience described.

Out of these discussions a work group was appointed that drafted the first version of the minute, which was in turn submitted to our Committee on Ministry and Oversight for review and revision. We then scheduled presentation at three successive monthly meetings for business, to allow first reading, circulation in the meeting community, further discussion and final approval. The entire process took a year. We were glad to be able to consider the issue when there was no particular request before us; we feel glad now to be able to respond straightforwardly to any of our members who request our support and clearness process.
