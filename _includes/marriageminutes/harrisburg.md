The Religious Society of Friends, Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, and Harrisburg Monthly Meeting have a long history of providing a welcoming faith community that is open to all. It is the policy of Harrisburg Monthly Meeting to not discriminate on the basis of race, national origin, age, physical or mental challenges, or gender/sexual preference, including through marriage or commitment ceremonies. For marriage and commitment ceremonies under the care of Harrisburg Monthly Meeting, we cherish all committed relationships in which there is an enduring, unselfish, and mutually devoted love between the two people.
