Minute on marriages and committed relationships under the care of Acadia Friends Meeting

We believe that couples, regardless of gender, can make the spiritual and social commitments necessary to found a family. We consider the commitments undertaken in these relationships by both the couple and the meetings to be those of marriage. As individuals we are not united as to whether such a union should be called a "marriage." As a meeting, we welcome applications from couples who unite with Quaker faith and practice, and choose to go through our usual process of clearness for marriage. We also believe the law should recognize same-gender relationships as having the same legal status as heterosexual marriages.
