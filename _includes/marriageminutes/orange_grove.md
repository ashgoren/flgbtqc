July 2008

At our Meeting for Worship on the Occasion of Doing Business on July 13, 2008, Orange Grove Meeting came to unity on the following minute:

In 1989, Orange Grove Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends reached unity in welcoming applications for marriage by all committed couples, including same sex couples.

In 1990, the Meeting minuted its support of equal legal status for same sex marriages.

Today, we affirm our previous unity and oppose any and all efforts to undermine marriage equality in California, specifically California Proposition #8.

To quote from Pacific Yearly Meeting's Faith and Practice: "It is consistent with Quakers' historical faith and testimonies that Friends practice a single standard of treatment for all couples who wish to marry."

Please join us and support this minute which speaks to our testimony on Equality.
