Twin Cities Friends Meeting, joyfully recognizing the diversity of sexual orientation within our religious community, affirms the goodness of committed, loving relationships that endure, are unselfish, and that provide mutual support and tenderness. We unite with the (1982) minute of Acton Monthly Meeting of New England Yearly Meeting which reads, “That so deeply enriching and spiritually fulfilling an experience as love between two individuals should be limited to those of the opposite sex we find inconsistent with the Quaker principle of the universality of love in the light.”

We now affirm our willingness as a Meeting to hold celebrations of living commitment under our care, in accordance with our traditional procedures, for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples, (when) one or both of those partners participate in our community as members or attenders. We intend to follow the same customary and careful process of arriving at clearness for any couple, regardless of sexual orientation, who should wish to unite under our care.

We are aware of the diversity of attitude toward the term “marriage” and leave to the couple the characterization of their relationship.

In cases where the laws of the State of Minnesota permit, should a couple celebrating with us their relationship desire to certify their union legally, the oversight committee will assist with arrangements.
