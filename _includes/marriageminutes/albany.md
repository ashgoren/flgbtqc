Our life is love, and peace, and tenderness; bearing one with another, and forgiving one another, and not laying accusations one against another, but praying for one another, and helping one another up with a tender hand. 

--Isaac Pennington, 1667

Acknowledging that Albany Friends Meeting has struggled for many years to find unity, we recognize that each of us brings different personal experiences to the search. We affirm the need for continued healing of those who have been hurt in the process and of the Meeting community as a whole.

We value that of God in all people. We honor each person's spiritual search. We welcome each person's search as part of the Meeting's search for divine truth. Albany Friends Meeting, following its normal clearness processes, welcomes all persons, including gays and lesbians, as full members of the Meeting, with all the responsibilities and rights, including marriage under the care of the Meeting.

We affirm the need for continuing discernment about family and relationships.
