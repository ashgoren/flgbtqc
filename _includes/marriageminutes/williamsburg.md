Williamsburg Friends Meeting is committed to the spiritual development of its members and attenders. In that spirit, the Meeting extends its active support to couples who make life-long commitments, regardless of their sexual orientation. Same gender relationships may be affirmed in a celebration of commitment under the care of the Williamsburg Meeting. In this way, the Williamsburg Friends Meeting declares its intention to embrace all couples who make life-long commitments, and who wish to live these out in the manner of Friends.
