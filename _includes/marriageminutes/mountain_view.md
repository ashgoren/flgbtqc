When two individuals, at least one of whom is a member or attender of our Meeting, request that their union be recognized and taken under the care of Mountain View Friends Meeting, we will appoint a clearness committee to meet with them to discern the nature, clarity and strength of their leading. The committee’s task is to help the couple and the Meeting reach unity whether it is with God’s leading that they enter into a commitment to each other, that there are no serious impediments to their ability to sustain a life-long relationship, and that their relationship may be expected to flourish by their love for each other within the Spirit.

The responsibility of a Friends Meeting to any couple under its care is to nurture the steadfastness of their commitment to each other and to God. We will support all committed Spiritually-centered relationships with our respect and love.

We affirm our willingness as a Meeting to celebrate the commitment of two people regardless of gender to live out their lives in a permanent and exclusive union.

The Meeting asked the Oversight Committee to bring the current marriage procedure into conformity with this minute and report back to the monthly meeting.
