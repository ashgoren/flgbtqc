Applications by couples, whether of the same or opposite gender, to be married under the care of meeting, shall be given the same tender, careful consideration. In Friends tradition, marriage takes place in a community of faith. Whether the couple calls their relationship a marriage or a commitment, we affirm the validity of the covenant. We look forward to the day when all couples who so wish enjoy the full recognition and entitlements of marriage.
