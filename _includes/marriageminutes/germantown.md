A Confirmation of Commitment for same sex couples may be held under the care of the Monthly Meeting as evidence of a serious, committed, and enduring relationship which provides the framework within which spiritual growth can occur. The same loving care and consideration should be given to both same-sec and heterosexual applicants, drawing on the customary procedures as outlined in Faith and Practice.

Germantown Friends Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends has been providing same sex couples with the opportunity to be married in a Religious Ceremony of Commitment since the 1980s. But such ceremonies, though they reflect the love and commitment of same sex partners for each other, have not had legal standing in the State of Pennsylvania. The recent decision of the Supreme Court of the United States, that the Defense of Marriage Act is unconstitutional, reinforces our belief that same sex marriage should be legal everywhere. Continued denial of marriage equality in the State of Pennsylvania is an obstacle to our desire that all couples under our care have the opportunity to be married in a ceremony that has both religious and legal validity. We therefore request that the State of Pennsylvania adopt a policy of marriage equality that will enable Germantown Friends Meeting to perform legally binding marriage ceremonies for all people of our faith community.
