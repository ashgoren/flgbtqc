Minute for Same-Sex Marriage 

Approved December, 2004

Minute 12: From our belief that there is that of God in everyone flows our testimony on the equality of all persons. Thus, Monthly Meeting of Friends of Philadelphia affirms its intention to support those couples in our Meeting community, regardless of their gender or sexual orientation, who have found a love that has led them to marry. The Meeting extends its loving care through its oversight of clearness for all couples. If clearness is found, the Meeting will celebrate the union with careful attention to a meeting for worship for marriage. In each case we will follow the same careful process of arriving at clearness in accordance with our traditions and procedures as stated in Philadelphia Yearly Meeting's Faith and Practice (Revised June 2002).

At its Monthly Meeting for Business, sixth month 11, 2006, the following minute was approved:

Montclair Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends affirms the right of any F/friend to form a lasting and meaningful relationship based upon integrity, mutual love and commitment. Such a relationship will be respected and upheld by the Monthly Meeting in all matters spiritual and temporal.
