1993

The essence of intimacy between persons is a matter of love, tenderness, fidelity and commitment. As a Monthly Meeting, we lovingly support and affirm those who ask for help in achieving these qualities in their relationships

We believe it is consistent with Friends historical faith and testimonies to adopt and practice a single standard for all committed relationships that are under our care. We are mindful that it is the Spirit that unites a couple, and we are witnesses thereof.

WE affirm our willingness as a monthly Meeting to hold appointed meetings to celebrate and acknowledge couplesâ€™ relationships. We will hold them in accordance with our traditional procedures, for both opposite-gender and same gender couples, when one or both of the partners participate in our community as members or attenders. We intend to follow the same customary and careful process of arriving at clearness for all couples who wish to unite under our care.

Because we believe that a committed relationship between two people who share their lives as equal partners is a spiritual union, it is appropriate to recognize this spiritual union at an appointed meeting for worship among friends and within the presence and moving of the Spirit. It is our belief that both the Meeting and the partners are nourished by this celebration.

We recognize this meeting for the couple, and certificate signed during that meeting, as the only necessary public expression of the union. The event shall be recorded in Meeting records as is customary. The Meeting will assist the couple with legal recording requirements if requested. For all couples, advice will be available regarding legal arrangements for care of each other, of family and of property.

[Please note: In the event that this minute is read aloud, it is our wish that the first paragraph be repeated here.]
