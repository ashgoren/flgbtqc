Original 1/12/1998

In January of 2008, our meeting approved a revision of our original 1998 minute on committed relationships. Here is the text:

Minute on Committed Relationships

Under the Care of Lancaster Monthly Meeting

Loving relationships undergird a peaceful society for all people and are an essential block in the foundation of the Religious Society of Friends. We believe that God's love is given to all. As God's love shines out from us, it strengthens all our relationships. We attest to the importance of one's individual search for God's will and to the importance of committed, loving relationships on life's path.

We of Lancaster Monthly Meeting support all committed relationships wherein is an enduring, unselfish and mutually devoted love between two people regardless of gender. We affirm our willingness to take such committed couples under the care of our Meeting. These committed relationships may have different names: most commonly marriage, but also union or covenant. Although not all committed relationships are presently recognized by the State, we hold all to be sacred commitments in the eyes of God, the couple, and our community. We will witness and celebrate such commitments for any couple in which one or both partners are members of our Meeting, with the recommendation of a Lancaster Monthly Meeting clearness committee and following the procedures outlined in Philadelphia Yearly Meeting's Faith and Practice (1997).
