3/6/1988

Whereas a discussion of human sexuality at the Meeting’s semi-monthly First-Day discussion session, held on the twenty-first day of Second month, 1988, led to a concern about the place of gay and lesbian sexuality in our Meeting, and in the Religious Society of Friends, the following Minute was brought to Monthly Meeting for Business for Consideration and Adoption and Dissemination within the larger Society of Friends:

Our Meeting holds in the light all gifts from God, primary of these being the potential for love. As a meeting, we make no distinction between heterosexual and same-sex expressions of love and human sexuality. We affirm all relationships that are non-exploitive and non-abusive and so not believe it is for us to judge another person’s choice of his or her sexual orientation or expression.

We recognize that these are troubled times for gay men and lesbian women and abhor all forms of discrimination—social, political, religious—that exist against them and commit ourselves to strive to rid our society and ourselves of such discrimination wherever it exists. We commit ourselves to actively educating ourselves and our Meeting on issues related to their condition and treatment in our society. Because of the possibility that our own Meeting might contribute tot the victimization of gay and lesbian people, through our own subtle and unintentioned forms of homophobia, we feel compelled to speak out to clarify our own relationship to gay and lesbian people and specifically endorse the following principles:

We recognize and affirm the dignity and worth of gay men and lesbian women, as we strive to find that of God in all people;

We welcome and embrace gay men and lesbian women as full and equal Members of the Meeting;

We recognize and affirm gay and lesbian expression of affection and sexuality, just as we affirm the heterosexual expression of love and affection;

We recognize and affirm the commitment of persons of the same sex who wish to have their relationship celebrated in the same or similar forms as provided for heterosexual couples, though some of our members have problems naming this Celebration a Marriage. In the spirit of love and acceptance, should any same sex couple wish their Celebration of Commitment to be named a Marriage, we will endeavor to see if we can find a way to embrace that naming.
