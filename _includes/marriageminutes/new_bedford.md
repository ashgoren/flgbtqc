New Bedford Friends are an open and affirming Christian community. In the spirit of Jesus of Nazareth, we offer fellowship to all religious seekers, diverse as they may be. Consequently, we approve of same-gender marriage.

We believe that marriage within the Meeting is a spiritual and communal commitment. Any couple affiliated with our Meeting, whether heterosexual or homosexual, may request a clearness committee for marriage. If approved by the committee and the Meeting, the couple may be married under our care.
