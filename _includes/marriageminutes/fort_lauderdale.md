Ft. Lauderdale Friends Meeting joyfully recognizes the diversity of sexual orientation within our religious community and affirms our support for all types of loving relationships. We affirm our willingness as a Meeting to hold celebrations of living commitment under our care, in accordance with our traditional procedures. We intend to follow the same customary and careful process of arriving at clearness for all couples, regardless of gender, when one or both parties participates in our community as members or attenders. We acknowledge such unions to be committed, under the care of the Meeting, and in accordance with the Spirit, no matter what a couple may choose to name their union. We leave to the couple the characterization of their relationship. In cases where the laws of the State of Florida permit, the oversight committee will assist with arrangements to certify a union legally, upon request.
