Chestnut Hill Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends holds itself ready to welcome requests for ceremonies of commitment to be held under the care and oversight of the meeting. Such ceremonies, following the traditional practices and procedures of Quakers, will affirm the union of a couple "before God and these our friends" without regard for the gender of the partners and with no requirement for state recognition or sanction of the unit.
