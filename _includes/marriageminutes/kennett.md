After struggling with the issues, Kennett Square Meeting has approved using the term “marriage” to describe the union Sarah Lanahan and her partner Cate will be having in June. In 1992 the meeting minuted their welcome to members regardless of sexual orientation and their openness to same –sex couples who wish to have unions performed under the meeting’s care, but Sarah and Cate are the first same-sex couple to ask for a ceremony, and they specifically asked to be “married” under the care of the meeting. Their request was initially treated like any other. They went through the clearness process and were approved for marriage. Except that not everyone approved our calling it a marriage. After sincere and centered ministry during Meeting for Business, those who could not unite with using the term “marriage” chose to stand aside, and the marriage was approved.
