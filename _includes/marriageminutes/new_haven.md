July, 1989 

endorsed Hartford (CT) minute

April 2002

New Haven Friends Meeting reaffirms its minute on same-gender marriage or committed relationships from July 1989, "The Meeting affirms the goodness of committed, loving relationships and offers recognition and support to those who share this ideal and desire to enter into a permanent relationship based upon it. By tradition, the Meeting recognizes committed union in a celebration of marriage under the care of the Meeting. The same loving care and consideration should be given to both same-sex and heterosexual applicants as outlined in Faith and Practice."

New Haven Friends Meeting endorses the right to civil marriage as it has already recognized religious marriage. This is with the understanding that even after civil marriage becomes available to same-gender couples, religious organizations will retain the right to decide for themselves whether to perform or recognize any marriage, just as they already do for every couple.
