November 2003

Given the importance of long-term committed relationships to the lives of the individuals involved and to society in general, and given Acton Monthly Meeting's 1982 affirmation that the overall quality of a relationship I more important than the genders of those involved, we support marriage under the care of the meeting for all couples, irrespective of gender. Same-gender marriages, lacking the support of civil law and custom, are in particular need of the meeting's ongoing, loving support.

[On Nov. 18, 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled that same- and opposite-sex couples must be given equal marriage rights under the state constitution.]
