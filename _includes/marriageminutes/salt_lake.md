With our growing appreciation for the diversity of sexual orientation within our community, we now affirm willingness to hold marriage under the care of the Meeting for all loving partners who wish to unite under our care, when one or both of those partners participates in our Meeting as members or attenders. We affirm that, in the areas of the marriage relationship which concern us as a religious body, and which we consider in our customary clearness process, there need be no difference between homosexual and heterosexual relationships, and that this encouragement of loving and stable couples is a benefit to the couple, the Meeting and the larger Society.
