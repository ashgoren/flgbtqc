7/1989

With our meetingâ€™s growing appreciation for the diversity of sexual orientation within our community, we now affirm our willingness to hold marriages for loving partners whether of same or opposite sex. We see this inclusiveness of our love for all people seeking marriage as a growing strength for our meeting. WE intend to follow the same customary and careful process of arriving at clearness for any couple, regardless of sexual orientation, which should wish to unite under our care when one or both of those partners participate in our meeting as members or attenders. As Friends, we seek to follow the leading of the Light in our relationships with persons of varying sexual orientation. In so doing, we recognize that the various reflections of the Light all deserve our loving concern.

The following minute was passed by Logan Monthly Meeting in Logan, Utah in September, 2004 and then, after a season of seasoning by Utah Friends Fellowship in January, 2005.

MINUTE ON EQUALITY OF MARRIAGE RIGHTS

It is fundamental to Quaker faith and practice that we honor the equality and integrity of all human beings. Therefore, it is our belief that it is consistent with Quakers' historical faith and testimonies that we practice a single standard of treatment for all couples who wish to be married. Given that the State offers legal recognition of opposite-gender marriage and extends significant privileges to opposite-gender couples who legally marry, we believe that a commitment to equality requires that all couples who wish to be married have the same rights and privileges. Therefore, we believe that the State should extend the rights and responsibilities of marriage to all couples regardless of sex or gender.
