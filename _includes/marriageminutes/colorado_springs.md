Friends recognize that spiritually enriching relationships are those that are enduring and unselfish and provide mutual support and tenderness. We also recognize the particular need to offer loving support to those people who share same-sex relationships.

We believe that all people are equal in the sight of God and that committed relationships are founded on a spiritual bondedness and unity among ourselves and with God. Hence, it is consistant with Friendâ€™s beliefs and testimonies to practice a single standard as outlined in our Faith and Practice for joining committed relationships under the care of the Meeting.
