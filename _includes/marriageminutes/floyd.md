Marriage is regarded by Friends as a spiritual commitment, a solemn covenant made in the presence of God and the Meeting between two people of any gender. Couples wishing to be married under the care of Floyd Friends must have the approval of the meeting. One member of the couple must be a member of Floyd Friends and must present written request at least 3 months prior to the wedding date, asking for oversight of the marriage. A small committee of Floyd Friends is appointed to inquire into the clearness of the couple for marriage.

Although marriage between same gender couples is not yet recognized by the Commonwealth of Virginia, Floyd Friends consider this part of the law to be unjust. Each time the wedding of same gender couples occurs at Floyd Friends Meeting, with the permission of the couple, the Clerk of the Court in Floyd, VA is notified, as is the procedure with the marriage of any other couple. Our meeting offers suggestions and support for same gender couples who wish to make legal arrangements which will secure their rights as a couple.
