Acknowledging that we are individually at different points in accepting extending the term marriage to same-gender couples but recognizing the need for spiritual commitment within our community, we affirm the following minute:

Wellesley Friends Meeting is an open and affirming faith community. We welcome all seekers. We believe that marriage within the meeting is a spiritual and communal commitment. Any couple affiliated with our meeting, regardless of gender, may request a clearness committee for marriage. If found clear, they may be married under the care of our meeting.
