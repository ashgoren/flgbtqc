1993

Southern California Quarterly Meeting approved a minute saying same sex couples should be allowed to register their marriage with the state in the same way a heterosexual couple does. The quarterly meeting also minuted that legal rights should be granted to all couples who are in “publicly acknowledged, committed relationships,” regardless of their sexual orientation.
