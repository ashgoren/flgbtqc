"...This is my beloved and this is my friend..." -- Song of Solomon 5:16

"For the right joining in marriage is the work of the Lord only, and not the priests or magistrates; for it is Gods ordinance and not Mans; and therefore Friends cannot consent that they should join them together; for we marry none; it is the Lords work and we are but witnesses." -- George Fox, 1669

Palm Beach Monthly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends recognizes that God may call a couple without regard to gender into a loving, committed relationship. All couples who request Marriage, a Commitment Ceremony or a Celebration of Union under the care of the Meeting will follow the same clearness process. After a couple, their clearness committee and the Meeting have arrived at clearness to proceed, the Meeting will witness their ceremony and will take the relationship under its care. We support all marriages and unions performed by other Quaker meetings, other religious bodies, or civil authorities.
