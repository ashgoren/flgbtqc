Columbia Friends Meeting affirms that everyone is welcome to attend and to participate in the activities of our meeting. Our intent is to practice no discrimination. We are here to worship God on the basis of silent waiting upon the word of God and to love God and to love and serve all peoples.

Columbia Friends Meeting welcomes all couples that request that Meeting take their proposed marriage, relationship, or commitment under its care. All couples approaching the Meeting with such a request will be expected to take on the same responsibilities and will be given the same privileges. Among these responsibilities is the requirement that at least one of the couple be well known to this Meeting and a member of the Religious Society of Friends. Another such responsibility is working with a Clearness Committee to determine whether there are any impediments to Meeting's care of this marriage. The Clearness Committee will then bring a recommendation about caring for this marriage to Meeting for Worship with a Concern for Business for final approval. Columbia Friends Meeting is guided by the current Illinois Yearly Meeting Faith and Practice section on marriage.
