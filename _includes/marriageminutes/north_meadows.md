Friends universally recognize marriage as a religious experience. North Meadows Circle of Friends seeks to bring a religious spirit to all relationships and to make special partnership permanent. As relationships grow into commitments, marriages are solemnized by God and the partners, and Friends witness this union, customarily called “marriage.”

For over 300 years, Meetings and the new family have invited all present to sign the Certificate of Marriage as witnesses to their commitment. North Meadows Circle of Friends continues the belief that the Certificate of Marriage is the only necessary public expression of this union.

We at North Meadows Circle of Friends affirm the equal opportunity of marriage for all individuals, including members of the same sex. Moreover, North Meadows Circle of Friends extends the marriage process – the care and ongoing nurture of the family by the Meeting – equally to same-sex and heterosexual partnerships.

North Meadows Circle of Friends strives to strengthen all relationships; as relationships grow so does our spiritual community. We care about the way parent and child, brother and sister, relate one with the other. God’s love is offered to all, and as that of God in every person shines, it helps to build and strengthen relationships of varying kinds, from the helping hand of friendship to lifelong partnerships.
