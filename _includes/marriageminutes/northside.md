Northside Friends Meeting affirms the goodness of committed, faithful, and loving relationships regardless of the sexual orientation of the couple. We are mindful that it is the Spirit which unites a couple and we are the witnesses.

We therefore affirm a single standard of practice for all committed relationships under our care, and offer couples our process for clearness and celebrations of marriage based of this standard.
