At Meeting for Worship with Attention to Business on Twelfth Month 8, 2002, Bloomington Friends Meeting, Bloomington, IN (Ohio Valley Yearly Meeting) approved the following minute:

Bloomington Friends Meeting has been led by the Light of the Living Christ to understand that God's love extends with equality to all people regardless of sexual orientation. This application of the traditional Quaker Testimony of Equality is part of a continuing revelation that began within the Religious Society of Friends over forty years ago with the publication of Towards a Quaker View of Sex. With the understanding that Christ has given us as Quakers today, we cannot accept actions or attitudes that diminish the humanity of lesbians, gay men, or bisexual persons, assign to them an inferior status within the Religious Society of Friends or the wider world, or suggest that their covenant relationships are in any way less sacred, less valid, or the cause for less joy than those of other persons.
