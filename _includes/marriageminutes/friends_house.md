Minute of the joint meeting of Elders and Overseers 

1987

This minute results from discussion begun in March 1987, which considered documents from the USA and Australia, and follows minutes from Mount Street Preparative Meeting (November 15, 1986) and Hardshaw East MM (March 23, 1987)

We are united in believing that committed relationships are to be encouraged; that meetings have a responsibility for loving, careful support in helping such relationships to succeed.

Bearing in mind consideration of public offence and the possibility of division within the Society, we are nevertheless, sure that we must begin with people with where they are. Where a committed couple (gay, lesbian or heterosexual) apply to their Preparative Meeting for a meeting for Worship to recognise and make public their commitment to one another, we believe that Friends already have the means whereby such a Meeting could be held.

We hope that it might possible to make this more widely known and understood. By this, we believe, we may come to see our way forward in this matter by responding to expressed needs.
