Friends at Narramissic Valley Meeting believe that marriage, and particularly marriage under the care of a Quaker Meeting, is not a commitment to be taken lightly. The Meeting, and especially its duly appointed committee on clearness, bears a responsibility to assure itself that the couple is entering into marriage not only lovingly but wisely as well. We believe that a Quaker Meeting must exercise the same care whether the couple is homosexual or heterosexual.
