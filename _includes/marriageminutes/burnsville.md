We believe Friends testimony of equality requires a single standard of treatment for all human beings and that all people share equally in the Light. We joyfully affirm our willingness as a Meeting to sanctify celebrations of marriage for both same and opposite gender couples. We intend to follow the order of Friends in arriving at clearness for all couples who are led to unite under our loving care.
