Same-Gender Marriage Source Document

January 2000

POSITION. Sacramento Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers)* affirms that it will conduct marriages of same-gender Quaker couples. Because of the laws of the State, these marriages do not have legal standing, but we will continue to advocate that same-gender couples be given the rights of civil marriage, and all other privileges and responsibilities that opposite-gender couples now enjoy.

Our advocacy includes opposition to Proposition 22 (the Knight Initiative on the Limitation of Marriage) appearing on the March 2000 California primary ballot. If passed, this proposition would limit marriage to the union of one man and one woman and prevent recognition of same-gender marriages performed in other states.

SOURCE. As Quakers, it is our experience that each person can receive inspiration directly from God. We clarify our understanding of our inspirations by joining together in expectant waiting, shared worship, study, discussion, and spiritual discernment. We are also guided by Biblical and other inspired writings, and by the wisdom and discipline of our Quaker tradition.

BACKGROUND. Historically, Quakers have been moved to act in support of human rights. Examples include Friends' work to abolish slavery, to secure women's rights, and more recently, to support interracial marriage and to abolish the death penalty.

Our meeting's leading to support same-gender marriage has emerged slowly out of at least four decades of personal experiences, study, and contact with the wider community. This process was awkward for us in the beginning. In hindsight, we realize the majority of us knew too little then to even discuss issues of same-gender relationships openly.

Gradually, Quakers who came to our meeting from other communities taught us that these were issues that some Friends meetings could discuss with ease. With their encouragement, some of us began to study relevant writings of Friends worldwide. We also became aware that a number of other Quaker meetings were marrying same-gender couples. The presence of gay and lesbian Friends in our meeting helped make the issues real for all of us.

By the early 1990s our meeting became more aware of the number of assaults on gay men, and police mistreatment of them. Our meeting wrote to the police proposing that neutral parties provide a listening service as a buffer between the adversaries. The service was created and functioned over a period of several months.

We were also deeply moved by two gay Quakers who invited us into their separate personal lives. The first of these was a man whose partner of 26 years was living with AIDS. At his request, we provided spiritual and practical support for him and his family. When his partner died, our meeting planned and conducted the memorial service.

Another Quaker touched the heart of the meeting by the open way in which he shared how he came to terms with being a gay man. He offered to help us consider performing same-gender marriages. There is no doubt that our developing fondness for this Friend, and his patience with us, opened our hearts and helped us see how God might lead us to take further action.

In January, 1999, a Friend gave powerful testimony in support of same-gender marriage after attending the holy union for two women conducted by Methodist ministers at the Sacramento Community Center. Many Friends were moved in response, and it was decided that the meeting should begin to work on this issue directly. We circulated relevant Quaker literature, then held four worship groups to share our experiences, concerns, and insights. This process allowed us to seek divine guidance and consider this topic over several months in a compassionate and inclusive manner. By September 1999, we reached unity with the Spirit on the following minutes:

Sacramento Friends Meeting affirms that we take same-gender marriages under our care in the same way that we do opposite-gender marriages.

Sacramento Friends Meeting affirms that it is our conviction that same-gender marriages should be afforded the same civil recognition as opposite-gender marriages, and that we seek ways to make this conviction known to the broader community.

REASONS. At the heart of our decisions is our understanding that sexual orientation is not a choice, but an intrinsic quality given to us by God. Its variations, on a continuum from same- to opposite-gender attraction, are a natural and blessed part of creation. Hence, we feel that a loving, same-gender relationship is a gift from God, rather than an addiction, an illness, or a sin.

Our meeting's decisions were also grounded in traditional Quaker values regarding committed relationships, equality, peace, and community support for diversity.

We hold the conviction that committed relationships spring from God's initiative. It is our experience that persons are drawn into loving relationships as one way of realizing the abundance of divine Light within them. We have the responsibility to recognize and support these spiritual unions, through the institution of marriage as well as through ongoing expressions of love and respect.

With regard to equality, we believe there is "that of God" in every person. This makes all people equally beloved by God and equally deserving of all human rights. We thus hold that same-gender couples merit the same opportunities as opposite-gender couples: to marry in their spiritual communities and to enjoy all the legal rights of civil marriage, such as shared medical benefits and decisions, custody of children, and inheritance of property.

Our emphasis on peace urges us to treat each person with the same all-encompassing care and acceptance that we ourselves receive from God. We are convinced that one's sexual orientation and the inspiration to form a committed partnership cannot be denied without causing profound spiritual suffering. Any attempt to discourage loving, same-gender relationships is therefore a form of violence to the soul.

Finally, we believe people reach their highest potential when they belong to a community that values diversity. Such a community grants people the opportunity to replace fear of same-gender relationships with appreciation for the variety of God's creations. It frees people to view themselves and others with newfound respect and openness. When society supports religious and civil marriages for same-gender couples, this will help create communities in which all people can feel safe, accepted, and encouraged to thrive.

CONCLUSION. We trust that this description of the decisions we have made, the reasons supporting them, and the process by which we came to them will help others as they strive to reach clearness on these issues. For our own part, we will continue to use the power of love to seek justice and equality for all people.
