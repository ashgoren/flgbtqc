March 1997

It is fundamental to Friends' faith and practice that we affirm the equality and integrity of all human beings. Equally, we hold that the purpose of recognizing and affirming committed relationships is to strengthen our families and communities.

Therefore, it is our belief that it is consistent with Friends' historical faith and testimonies that we practice a single standard of treatment for all committed relationships.

Given that the State offers legal recognition of opposite-gender marriage and extends significant privilege to couples who legally marry, we believe that a commitment to equality requires that same-gender couples be granted the same rights and privileges.

Therefore, we believe that the Sate should permit gay and lesbian couples to marry and share fully and equally in the rights and responsibilities of marriage.

[Note: Waterboro's minute is one approved by Friends for Lesbian and Gay Concerns in 1995 and sent to North American yearly meetings asking them to forward it to their constituent monthly meetings for consideration. In February 1997, NEYM Ministry and Counsel did so with a cover letter affirming there was no unity on same-gender marriage in NEYM as a whole and that forwarding the letter as requested did not imply a Ministry and Counsel endorsement of the minute.]
