Friends Meeting at Cambridge affirms that relationships between persons of the same sex can be as committed and holy as the heterosexual relationships that Friends have called marriage can be. Friends intend to give the same loving care and consideration to both same-sex and heterosexual relationships. We therefore welcome the opportunity to celebrate God’s love made manifest in the love of a couple at a meeting for worship appointed to celebrate their union, according to the good order of Friends, whether the couple is of the same of different sex. We are not yet clear whether same-sex unions should have a different name than heterosexual union.

We recognize that our explorations of the nature of marriage have raised certain issues with respect to our clearness process, and to the Meeting’s oversight for all couples under its care, including the care of a partnership dissolution. We direct the Meeting on Ministry and Counsel and the Marriage and Family Life Committee, together with concerned Friends, to explore these issues, and as needed, to bring recommendations for action to the Meeting.
