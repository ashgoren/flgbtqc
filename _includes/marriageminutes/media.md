Minute for Marriage Equality

Friends see weddings as the affirmation and celebration of a spiritual union between loving adults. Media Friends Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends offers this minute in support of marriage as a sacred commitment to love one another in faithful partnership. We believe that marriage under the care of the Meeting is a spiritual and communal experience. We consider all requests for marriage by those who have a relationship with our Meeting in the spirit of equality. We do this with care, respect, and love, guided by The Spirit and in the good order of Friends as described in Faith and Practice, honoring how we are all uniquely created in the image of Spirit.
