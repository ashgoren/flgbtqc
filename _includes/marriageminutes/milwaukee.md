1987

Friend’s testimony of equality requires a single standard of treatment for all human beings. We are all equal in the sight of God, and our committed relationships are founded on a spiritual bondedness and unity among ourselves and with God that is not determined by our gender or our sexual orientation. We believe it is consistent with Friends’ historical faith and testimonies to adopt and practice a single standard of treatment for all committed relationships that are under our care.

Therefore, we now affirm our willingness as a meeting to hold celebrations of loving commitment under our care, in accordance with our traditional procedures, for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples, when one or both of those partners participate in our community. We intend to follow the same customary and careful process of arriving at clearness for any couple, regardless of sexual orientation, who should wish to unite under our care.

We are aware of the diversity of attitudes toward the term ‘marriage’ and leave to the couple the characterization of their relationship. The event can be called a ‘celebration of commitment’ or a ‘celebration of marriage.’
