Providence Friends affirm that of God in every person. We attest that this principle embraces all individuals, regardless of sex or gender. We rejoice in the love shared between two people as one of the greatest gifts of God. It is our hope that the religious life of the Meeting offers continuing tender support for all families in our Quaker community. We encourage and uphold couples who wish to express their love, their spiritual union, and their commitment to one another in a permanent relationship. We will give the same loving care and consideration to couples regardless of sex or gender, who request marriage under the care of the Meeting. The process of approval will follow the good order of Friends as described in Faith and Practice of New England Yearly Meeting of Friends. approved by Providence Monthly Meeting, 11th mo. 2006.
