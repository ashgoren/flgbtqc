Morningside MM offers guidance and support to all couples who desire community recognition of their relationship. This includes heterosexual and homosexual couples, one of whom is a member of the Society of Friends. The meeting respects the right of the couple to name their relationship.

All of this is accomplished by following, in so far as possible, the marriage procedures outlined in New York Yearly Meetingâ€™s Faith and Practice giving comprehensive attention to the implications of the proposed relationship.
