Marriage in our time is understood to be a legal contract between a man and a woman. Yet Unami Friends are clear that whatever is available to our heterosexual couples should also be open to same-sex couples. Therefore, we offer all couples “celebrations of commitment” wherein we give community recognition to loving relationships. This would be accomplished following procedures similar to those for marriage as outlined in Faith and Practice.

As a religious society we are committed to upholding the sacramental qualities of life. It is a sacrament when two souls are united by love and wish to make a public commitment. Through a clearness committee, the Meeting can offer guidance in the form of queries and shared insight and offer listening support that may help the couple come to a deeper understanding of the many aspects of their commitment to each other. The clearness committees, however, should be sensitive to the differing needs and expectations of each relationship. We expect clearness committees to consider with the couple what needs to be done to settle the legal benefits and responsibilities which come with marriage and other committed relationships.
