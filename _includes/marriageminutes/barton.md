Barton-Glover Friends Meeting supports committed, loving relationships that are based in mutual respect and caring.

When couples ask to be married under our care, we will offer them a process of clearness and, if appropriate, provide oversight for a ceremony which celebrates and confirms their relationship in Spiritual Light and within the community.

In deciding whether to take a marriage under our care, we will consider whether the relationship supports the personal and spiritual unfolding of both partners, and whether both people understand and are prepared to make this major life commitment. As part of our clearness process we will review our minute on marriage as well as Faith and Practice with each couple. We will also consider the relationship between the couple and this Meeting. We will not base this decision on the genders of the individuals involved.

We recognize the perils involved in blending secular and sacred matters. We fully support equal rights for marriage regardless of sexual orientation."
