Santa Fe Meeting is called to witness for sanctity of loving relationships.

When, as Friends we witness the Light within, we cherish and strengthen all our relationships. When we witness that of God in every person, our spiritual gathering grows. Witnessing the sanctity of bonds of love, we extend that witness into our greater community.

As a Religious Society, we affirm all relationships centered in love. We honor the determination of a couple regardless of gender, to celebrate their loving commitment to one another under our care. After the manner of Friends, we will follow the procedure in Pacific Yearly Meetingâ€™s Faith and Practice to arrive at clearness for all couples preparing to make a sacred commitment of their union.

We are mindful that at this time only heterosexual couples have the right to legal privileges and protections in the current legal system.
