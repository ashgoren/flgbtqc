Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, in session, felt strongly to affirm all marriages conducted under the care of Monthly Meetings. We approved this minute prepared through two revisions: "Philadelphia Yearly Meeting affirms the marriage of same-gender couples conducted under the care of Monthly Meetings of the Religious Society of Friends." We know the truth of this but our sense is that our wording might be imperfect. We are asking all Monthly Meetings to reflect on this minute and to respond in writing to Yearly Meeting before its next annual sessions.
