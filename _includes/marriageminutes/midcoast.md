April, 1996

Midcoast Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends rejoices in the love between two people as one of the greatest gifts of God. The religious life of the Meeting offers continuing tender support to all couples in our Quaker community who wish to express their love and commitment to one another in a permanent relationship. The same loving care and consideration will be given both to same-gender and heterosexual couples who request marriage under the care of the Meeting. The process for approval will follow the good order of Friends as described in Faith and Practice.

Second Minute, January, 1990:

The same term, marriage, will be utilized to designate the celebrations of commitment for both heterosexual and homosexual couples.

The procedure for marriage under the care of the Meeting outlined in Faith and Practice shall be followed for all couples seeking clearness for marriage under the care of the Meeting. Ministry and Counsel is asked to recommend a series of queries for all couples regarding such topics as legal commitments, guardianship of children/parents, and inheritance issues.

The Meeting looks forward to the day when all married couples will enjoy the full range of civil privileges and social acceptance.

The Meeting takes seriously its commitment to couples under its care, and it encourages them to turn to the Meeting for support and counsel.
