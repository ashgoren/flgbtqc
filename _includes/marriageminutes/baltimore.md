Minute on Marriage (May 2006)

It is fundamental to the faith and practice of the Religious Society of Friends that we honor the equality and integrity of all human beings.

We affirm the words of the 1988 Faith and Practice of Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends which states that "Marriage is regarded by Friends as a spiritual commitment, a solemn covenant made in the presence of God and the Meeting."

Through our faith in the continuing revelation of Truth we are led to practice a single standard for those committed couples who wish their union to be recognized formally under the care of the Meeting.

We affirm our testimony of Equality that requires the same rights, privileges and responsibilities for all couples united under the care of the Meeting.
