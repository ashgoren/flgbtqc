From our belief that there is that of God in everyone flows our testimony on the equality of all persons. Thus, Lansdowne Friends Meeting affirms our willingness to consider clearness for marriage for all couples, including same sex couples, who have a substantial relationship with our meeting. In each case we will follow the same careful process of arriving at clearness in accordance with our traditional procedures. At every stage we intend to treat all couples with respect and love.
