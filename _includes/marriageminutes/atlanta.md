Atlanta Friends Meeting affirms our willingness as a Meeting to hold celebrations of loving commitment under our care. We intend to follow the same customary and careful process of arriving at clearness for any couple who should wish to unite under our care, regardless of sexual orientation, when one or both of these partners participate in our community.

We are aware of the diversity of attitudes toward the term marriage and leave to the couple the characterization of their relationship – whether a celebration of marriage, commitment, or joining.

The Meeting acknowledges the certificate signed by the couple and those present at the ceremony as the witness of Friends to the couple’s spiritual union. Mindful that only the heterosexual couples among us have the right to legally sanctioned marriage and its privileges, the Meeting asks Friends, and particularly couples preparing for marriage, to examine how best to respond and bear witness to the inequalities still present in the legal system.

The Atlanta Friends Meeting approved the following Minute on legal marriage for same-sex and transgendered couples (as a supplement to our previous Minute on marrige)on Eleventh Month 21, 2004:

Minute: Atlanta Friends Meeting re-affirms our willingness as a Meeting to hold celebrations of loving commitment, including marriage, under our care for any couple who should wish to unite under our care, regardless of sexual orientation and gender, when one or both of these partners participate in our community. Mindful that only the heterosexual couples among us have the right to legally sanctioned marriage and its privileges, the Atlanta Friends Meeting opposes efforts to further limit the legal rights of same-sex and transgendered couples and families. The Atlanta Friends Meeting also supports their efforts to gain increased legal protections, including the option of choosing the benefits of civil marriage on the same basis as heterosexual couples.
