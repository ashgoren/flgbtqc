Richmond Friends Meeting extends its loving care and support to all individuals and couples in our Meeting community. A committed, loving relationship provides a framework within which spiritual growth can occur. Therefore, we affirm our willingness to hold a celebration of commitment under the care of the Meeting for same-gender couples at least one of whom is a member or active attender of Richmond Friends Meeting. This is evidence of our spiritual support of such a long-term relationship. The customary process for marriage outlined in Faith and Practice will be followed.
