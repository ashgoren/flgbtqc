In recognition of the Truth, which dwells within each one of us, we acknowledge that many kinds of loving relationships grow from Divine Spirit. We uphold the dignity and godliness of all loving relationships regardless of the gender of persons involved. We believe that our sexuality is a gift and recognize in it the potential to share and express pleasure and love.

As a meeting, we affirm and seek to provide spiritual care and nurture for all loving relationships led by the Light and grounded in mutual respect, affection, honesty, and commitment, whether the individuals are of the same or different sex. When any persons request to marry or to affirm their relationship in a ceremony of commitment under the care of the meeting, we will approach the clearness process with tenderness and respect.
