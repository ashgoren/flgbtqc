We, the members of the New Paltz Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends, support equality in unions of life commitment or marriage and all the legal benefits, rights, and responsibilities customarily associated with marriage. We have struggled with the use of the term “marriage.” There are Friends among us who prefer to use the term “marriage” to apply only to heterosexual unions. WE as a Meeting support the right of the couple to name their own union. We all join to uphold the spiritual unions of all couples regardless of gender or sexual orientation.
