Minute on Equality for Queer People

The Religious Society of Friends from its earliest days has valued that of God in everyone. This value, as embodied in the testimony of Equality, has long led Friends to work for a more just society and to stand by those who face discrimination.

Today we recognize that discrimination is faced by queer* adults and youth in the form of unjust laws, acts of rejection and violence. Frequently the results are serious psychological injuries which include a sense of inferiority, depression, risky behaviors and suicide.

Santa Cruz Friends Meeting re-affirms creating a world in which all are honored and accepted as equal members of our society. We affirm that:

+ all queer people should have full and equal rights to live their lives, without fear, as they are led.

+ the community environment of Santa Cruz Friends Meeting is and will continue to be a space where queer people are safe to be open about their identities, their needs, and their fears and concerns.

+ equality for queer people shall be reflected in our work within the Meeting and in our community outreach.

*For the purposes of this minute, "queer" includes individuals who identify as gay, lesbian, or bisexual; individuals who identify as a gender other than that assigned them at birth; individuals who are classified as intersexed, such as those born with "ambiguous" genitals; and any other individual whose sexual or romantic attractions or whose gender or sex differ from societyÂ’s norms or expectations.
