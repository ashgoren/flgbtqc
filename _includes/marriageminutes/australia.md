Friends recognise that spiritually enriching relationships are those that are enduring and unselfish and provide mutual support and tenderness. There is a particular need to offer loving support to those who are sharers in relationships other than marriage, as they do not always receive the support and approval of the community as a whole. Such relationships include unmarried couples and homosexual pairs.

If the meeting feels that a relationship is stable and loving, a suitable opportunity might be found when Friends could express their love and support for the individuals. Such support may be helpful in improving the quality of the relationship and also in encouraging openness and candor.

Friends need to respect the rights of those concerned to make their own decisions about a lifestyle congenial to them.

Meetings need to recognise that not all Friends feel able to support these relationships, and there is a need for sensitivity to those who have a conscientiously held belief that heterosexual marriage is the appropriate commitment.
