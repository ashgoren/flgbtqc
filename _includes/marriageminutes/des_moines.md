We affirm our willingness as a meeting to participate in celebrations of marriage or celebrations of commitment in accordance with our traditional procedures, for both opposite-sex and same-sex couples, when one or both of the partners is a member or regular attender of our meeting. WE intend to follow the same customary and careful process of arriving at clearness and confirming the commitment for all couples who wish to unite under our care. At every stage we intend to treat all couples with the same respect, the same care, and the same status. Because relationships are growing and living entities, we recognize also our responsibility to continue to provide care and support for each relationship for both partners as individuals, in the same way that we strive to care for all individuals in the meeting.
