July 4, 1987

Minute 63 of Hardshaw East Special Monthly Meeting, 22 March 1987 has been received, and has been introduced by Susan Hartshome.

We recognise that many homosexual people play a full part in the life of the Society of Friends. This minute asks us whether we accept fully their relationships. There are homosexual couples who consider themselves to be married and believe that this is as much a testimony of divine grace as a heterosexual marriage. They miss the public recognition of this in a religious ceremony even though this could have no legal significance.

We have found the word "marriage" difficult, but we are clear that we have a responsibility to support all members of our meetings and to uphold them in their relationships. We can expect that some homosexual couples will ask their meetings for a celebration of their commitment to each other. Meetings already have the means whereby meetings for worship can be held for this purpose but we recognise that many find this a difficult matter. The acceptance of homosexuality distresses some Friends.
