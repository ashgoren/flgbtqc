We affirm that we should extend to all individuals, regardless of their sexual or affectional orientation, the benefits of a public celebration of their mutual commitment. We see this as desirable for the growth of their relationships and for the enrichment of their communities. We therefore ask Canadian Yearly Meeting to enable and encourage monthly meetings to recognize the religious celebration of union between same sex couples.
