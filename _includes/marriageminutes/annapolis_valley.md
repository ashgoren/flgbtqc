Wolfville, Nova Scotia; Canadian Yearly Meeting [FGC & FUM] 

8/1988

We feel the quality of a relationship is more important than the gender of the partners. …we have found that undertaking the challenge of discussing this issue has lead us to a deeper understanding of marriage in general. …AS there are no references to gender in the section on Marriage in Organization and Procedure, and no requirement to be legally registered, we ask CYM (Canadian Yearly Meeting) to affirm that Monthly Meetings are free to act as they see way clear on this issue. WE ask Friends to trust in the Quaker marriage clearness process, and to trust to the couple and the Meeting with whom they worship to discern the truth and right ordering for each particular situation

We continue to seek further guidance of the Light within ourselves and others and wish to encourage dialogue with all those who agree or disagree with us. We no longer will participate in the denial of religious support for loving relationships, whatever their gender composition.
