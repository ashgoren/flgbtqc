As Friends we are lead to acknowledge and respect That of God within each individual and we have historically been lead to take action in support of the basic dignity and equality of all people.

Recently New England Yearly Meeting has asked us to consider our response to the issue of same-gender marriage. Following careful consideration we approve the following:

Upon request by a couple, Eggemoggin Reach Friends Meeting will recognize same-gender relationships through the same careful process we would use to arrive at clearness for all couples who wish to unite under our care, following Friends traditions and practices. Similarly, we recognize our responsibility to provide continuing nurture to such couples in the same manner as that accorded to heterosexual couples.

Acknowledging that there is as yet no legal recognition of marriage for same-gender couples and that there are many unique difficulties that such couples will face in society, it is our feeling that this action affirms the spiritual nature of a life-long commitment between partners. Further, we wish to affirm and celebrate the integrity and inner light of couples who make such a commitment, and to act lovingly, holding open our spiritual community in offering nurture and support to those who may have felt oppression by the prejudices of larger society.

We are aware that taking this step also calls us to deepen our understanding of marriage under the care of meeting and of support for all married and committed couples within our meeting.
