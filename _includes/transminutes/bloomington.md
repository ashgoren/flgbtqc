In Friends' tradition of advocating for justice and equality, members and attenders of Bloomington-Normal Friends Meeting welcome all who wish to join us in worship, including LGBTIQ (lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgendered, intersex, and questioning/queer) people. In the wider U.S. society, we support same-sex marriage and other forms of equality. We declare our Meeting for Worship to be a safe space for people who may feel their sexual orientation makes some other places of worship unsafe. We encourage Illinois Yearly Meeting likewise to declare ILYM a welcoming and safe space for LGBTIQ people.
