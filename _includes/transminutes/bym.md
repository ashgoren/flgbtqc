### MINUTE ON THE CIVIL AND HUMAN RIGHTS OF TRANSGENDER AND NON-BINARY PEOPLE

Baltimore Yearly Meeting of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) rejoices in the presence of transgender people in our midst including non-binary people. Our transgender members enrich our community and deepen our worship. We believe that there is that of God in everyone and everyone has gifts to bring to the world. Whenever anyone is excluded, Godâ€™s ability to work in our midst is diminished.

We commit ourselves to support transgender people in our meetings and the civil and human rights of our transgender members and all transgender people. We also commit to enlarging our understanding of the experience of being transgender. No one should face discrimination in employment, housing, health care, or otherwise, or have their dignity assaulted and their human rights curtailed because of their gender identity.

### WHY WE DRAFTED THIS MINUTE

Since the November 2016 elections, we have witnessed a growing backlash against transgender people in the United States. The Trump administration has taken numerous steps weakening protection for transgender people in such areas as military service, prison assignment, health care, employment, schooling, and policing.

It is particularly important for us as people of faith to testify that our religious experience leads us to love, acceptance, and nondiscrimination, and to support the civil rights of these friends and family members.
