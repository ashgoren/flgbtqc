After an extended period of consideration that had included several editing changes, Friends approved the below minute that initially had been delivered to the Peace and Social Action Committee by Robb Yurisko.

North Columbus Friends Meeting testifies to the truth of the prophetic witness of Friends who have come before us declaring that that of God can be found within everyone. In modern times, we find the testimonies of early Friends even more relevant and revolutionary as each year passes.

North Columbus Friends Meeting minutes our support for and affirmation of all transgender, intersex, gender-fluid, and non-binary persons. We find that unconditional love and inclusion allow the fullest Light into our Meeting and in our lives.

We invite and welcome into fellowship with us all persons so that they may share and we may be blessed by that which is of God within each of us.
