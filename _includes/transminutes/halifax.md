Minute on Gender Expression and Identity

Halifax Monthly Meeting in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada

Approved on January 10, 2024

From the beginnings of the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers) in the 1600s, Friends have sought a religious experience that is personal - free from doctrinal creeds and institutional hierarchy. 

With this minute we affirm an understanding of spiritual equality and also affirm our growing understanding and respect for gender expression, identity, and sexuality. We acknowledge that we are still learning, but we recognize that when we embrace the full spectrum of gender and sexual identities in our Meeting and across our wider community, our worship deepens and our community is enriched. We seek to extend our loving care to all people. Our experience has been that Spiritual gifts are not distributed with regard to sexual orientation or gender identity and that the life of our Meeting and its work have been immeasurably enriched over the years by the full participation and Spirit-guided leadership of gender-diverse Friends. Our experience confirms that we are all equal before God.

We commit to:

— Continuing to learn about gender and sexuality concerns, and particularly learning how to support those who have experienced discrimination and other violence based on their gender identities or expressions.

— Honouring statements of personal pronouns among members, attenders, and visitors, and using inclusive language in our written communications. 

— Creating a safe and welcoming place.
