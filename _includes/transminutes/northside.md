Who We Are

Northside Friends Meeting is a Quaker Meeting affiliated with the Illinois Yearly Meeting of Friends and Friends General Conference.

We unite with the central Friends belief that all people have the power to become children of the Light, that there is that of God in every person.

We hold that in Quaker worship we can come to know that Light within ourselves.

We stand by Friends testimonies of Integrity, Simplicity, Equality, and Peace.

We honor Quaker process.

We gather for silent worship on First Day (Sunday) mornings at 10:00 am at the Japanese American Service Committee, 4427 North Clark Street in Chicago. Our meeting space is handicap accessible.

Northside Friends is a diverse community. All are welcome among us. Families of all sorts, single parents, youth and elders, people of all races and orientations may participate in our worship. As diverse as we are demographically, we are as diverse theologically as well. Friends come from a wide variety of faith traditions and histories. Instead of finding our diversity troubling, it is for us a cause for spiritual celebration and intellectual challenge; there is no impediment here to genuine worship, spiritual seeking and finding.

Since the earliest days of Northside, we have enjoyed a gay/ lesbian presence. In the 1980's we supported our members through the AIDS crisis, in 1989 we celebrated our first lesbian marriage, and Friends of our Meeting with our support have twice organized the annual North American Mid-Winter Gathering of Friends for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender, and Queer Concerns. In every way, lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, intersex, queer, and questioning people are welcome in our community.
