A rewrite of the FLGBTQC website to use a static site generator - aka an excuse to teach myself Jekyll

### Development
- `jekyll serve --livereload`

### Deployment
- `jekyll build`
- upload `_site` folder

### To Do:
- add CI via Github actions or similar so don't have to upload folder manually
- add all the actual content
