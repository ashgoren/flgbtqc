## Gatherings
Twice a year, Friends for Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, and Transgender Concerns typically gather to worship, conduct business, pray, and play. In July, our numbers are large, and we are a visible and valued presence at the Friends General Conference Gathering. We are a community within a community there, worshiping together daily but dispersing throughout the Gathering at the rise of Meeting.

Most Februaries, we meet for a long weekend dedicated to FLGBTQC work and play. Our numbers are often smaller, from 100 to 200, and we retreat together to attend to old relationships and deepen new ones.
