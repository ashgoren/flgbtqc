# Marriage Minutes

This is the collection of Marriage Minutes and other minutes which affirm same-sex unions or commitments among Quakers.

The collection is a work in progress. We have incorporated the minutes previously collected by S. Cohen, as well as any other Minutes we have been able to locate. We have incorporated a list generated by late Wallace Cayard of Cranberry Twp, PA by surveying Monthly Meetings in the United States in 1997 and 2004, published in Friends Journal (April 2005). His work has nearly doubled our collection.

If you have a Marriage Minute or Minute for other Committment Ceremony for Same-Sex couples that isn't on our list please alert the [website manager](mailto:{{layout.website_manager.email}}).

**Click on a name below to see that minute, or click the "View all" button to see all of them.**
